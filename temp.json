This policy outlines the unlawful nature of discriminatory practices in various contexts, including employment, provision of goods and services, education, and accommodation. It also addresses sexual harassment, emphasizing the importance of creating a workplace free from such behavior. By documenting this policy in a clear and understandable manner, employees are informed of their rights and responsibilities, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and fostering a respectful work environment."

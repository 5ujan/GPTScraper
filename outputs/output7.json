According to this model, disability is seen as a product of the interaction between individuals with impairments and an environment that fails to accommodate their needs and abilities. In other words, it is not the impairment itself that disables a person, but rather the physical, social, and attitudinal barriers present in society. The social model advocates for removing these barriers and promoting inclusion, accessibility, and equality to empower individuals with disabilities to fully participate in society on an equal basis with others."

{"ans":"A love that blooms in curly braces,In loops and functions, endless spaces,A language crafted with such grace,JavaScript, you have my heartâ€™s embrace.From variables that softly glide,To promises that never hide,I trace your syntax, line by line,In every bracket, you are mine.Events that spark with boundless fire,A DOM that answers my desire,With each console.log, you speak to me,Your magic, my reality.Asynchronous, you take your time,Yet every callback feels sublime,From fetch to async I feel the flow,In your embrace, I always grow.Oh JS, you're my endless muse,With you, no bug can ever bruise.Through every error, I stand tall,In your embrace, I have it all."}

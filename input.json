Research information required for legal compliance1.1.  Identify sources of information about compliance requirements1.2.  Evaluate own area of work and determine scope of compliance requirements1.3.  Access and interpret information relevant to area of work1.4.  Identify risks, penalties and consequences of non compliance1.5.  Assess and act on need for specialist legal advice1.1 – Identify sources of information about compliance requirements1.2 – Evaluate own area of work and determine scope of compliance requirementsBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Identify at least five sources of information on compliance requirements⮚ Evaluate their own area of work and determine the scope of compliance requirements.Compliance requirementsIt is essential to be aware of the various compliance requirements that apply to your business. The identification of requirements will enable you to develop compliance plans and ensure that you don’t breach any rules or regulations. There are numerous sources of information which relate to specific businesses operating within Australia and abroad. You may consider hiring a compliance specialist and using software to manage information about your responsibilities.Information on relevant compliance requirements may include:⮚ Correspondence, emails and other written information provided by internal and external personnel contacted during search activities⮚ Information downloadable from relevant websites⮚ Newsletters, bulletins and information sheets⮚ Periodic documentation distributed by relevant regulatory authorities and standards bodies⮚ Published information on legislation, regulations, codes of practice, standards, licensing requirements, standard operating procedures, etc.⮚ Records of conversations and meetings with relevant internal and external personnel.Evaluating your area of workThe scope of compliance requirements will vary, depending on the nature of your organisation and the specific role that you fulfil. You might have responsibility for overseeing the employment of new staff members, transfer of goods and services, maintenance of policies, and limitation of environmental riskfactors. It will be necessary to research and act in accordance with rules, regulations, and ethical requirements specific to your own area of work.Your organisation may have policies and procedures relating to:⮚ Children in the workplace⮚ Codes of conduct⮚ Codes of practice⮚ Complaints management⮚ Continuing professional education⮚ Discrimination⮚ Dignity of risk⮚ Duty of care⮚ Human rights:o universal declaration of human rightso relationship between human needs and human rightso frameworks, approaches and instruments used in the workplace⮚ Informed consent⮚ Mandatory reporting⮚ Practice standards⮚ Practitioner/client boundaries⮚ Privacy, confidentiality and disclosure⮚ Policy frameworks⮚ Records management⮚ Rights and responsibilities of workers, employers and clients⮚ Industrial relations legislation and requirements relevant to organisation⮚ Specific requirements in the area of work, including:o key practices that are prohibited by lawo auditing and inspection regimeso main consequences of non-complianceo need to apply for licences and associated mandatory training and certification requirementso statutory reporting requirementso business insurances required including public liability and workers compensationo accreditation requirementso requirements to develop and implement plans, policies, codes of conduct or incorporate certain workplace practices⮚ Work role boundaries – responsibilities and limitations of different people⮚ Work health and safety.Regulatory authoritiesArguably one of the most important sources of information on compliance requirements is regulatory authorities. These are public bodies that take responsibility for governing particular industries. They are created by statute with the primary task of protecting the public.An example of a regulatory authority in Australia would be the Department of Health, which seeks to improve and maintain the high standards of Australian health care by ‘strengthening evidence-based policy advice’ and ‘improving program management, research, regulation and partnerships with other government agencies, consumers and stakeholders.’Regulatory authorities:⮚ Lay out compliance requirements⮚ Set conditions for and restrictions on work⮚ Set standards⮚ Exercise authority⮚ Make important decisions⮚ Enforce decisions⮚ Discipline businesses that fail to comply with requirements.There are many regulatory authorities in Australia, so it is important to fully research those which apply to your industry.Activity 1A1.3 – Access and interpret information relevant to area of work1.4 – Identify risks, penalties and consequences of non complianceBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Access information on legal and ethical compliance⮚ Interpret compliance information⮚ Identify at least three potential consequences of breaching compliance regulations.Accessing information on legal and ethical complianceIt is quite likely that you will be aware of the various legal and ethical compliance issues that relate to your area of work. However, it is important to keep up to date and ensure that you are adhering to the required standards.You may obtain information on internal and external compliance requirements from the following sources:⮚ Internal policies, standard operating procedures, standards, and codes of practice⮚ Published material relevant to compliance held in either internal or external libraries⮚ Relevant legislation, regulations, and licensing requirements pertinent to the organisation's operations and sphere of business.You may also access these sources of information on compliance:⮚ Stored compliance data⮚ Continuous improvement and quality assurance information⮚ Records of business finances and contracts⮚ Promotional data and customer interactions⮚ Business performance records⮚ Policies and procedures.Interpreting compliance informationThe relevance of some compliance information may be quite obvious. You may identify the need to follow specific organisational procedures and act in accordance with laws. However, it may be worth seeking the assistance of other staff members in some instances. They might have the knowledge required to interpret and explain detailed aspects of compliance.If there is nobody within your organisation that can provide assistance, then you may consider the option of hiring an external legal expert. They should be able to detail the relevance of business legislation and ethical expectations. You may also arrange meetings for the analysis and evaluation of major compliance issues.Breaches of complianceA breach will occur whenever your business fails to act in accordance with legislative and organisational compliance requirements. This may happen as a result of failing to identify the relevant business laws and potential consequences of non-compliance.If instances of non-compliance are identified by regulatory bodies, your business could face serious repercussions.The risks, penalties, and other consequences include:⮚ Government fines⮚ Seizure of business property⮚ Suspension or redundancy of individuals responsible for non-compliance⮚ Audits and payments for workers who’ve been adversely affected by instances of non- compliance⮚ Criminal prosecution of business representatives⮚ Dissolution of the business.Activity 1B1.5 – Assess and act on need for specialist legal adviceBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Seek specialist legal advice on compliance⮚ Identify at least three pieces of Australian legislation relating to compliance.Seeking specialist legal adviceBusinesses are often reluctant to seek legal advice due to concerns about the costs and amount of time required for legal proceedings. However, such advice should be sought if you lack the knowledge and expertise required to deal with compliance issues internally. You’ll discover that there are numerous sources of legal information, including local business consultancies, and citizen’s advice bureaus. You may also consider the option of hiring a lawyer or solicitor.You may seek advice for:⮚ Help in the identification of laws and regulations that apply to your business⮚ Assistance in the identification of relevant business licenses and subsequent application⮚ Consultancy on the completion of legally binding forms and contracts⮚ Support during legal disputes with employees and customers⮚ Advice on the matter of intellectual property⮚ Specialist assistance.You’ll find that there are a wide variety of legal firms specialising in particular aspects of the law. It is important to identify a firm with a proven track record of assisting organisations in your market.Dedicated lawyers may be able to help you identify areas of compliance and resolve disputes that occur as a result of legal breaches.Australian standards of complianceYou will have to operate in accordance with different organisational principles and legislative standards specific to the territories of Australia. The major requirements are outlined in the ISO 19600 Compliance Program. This highlights the need for compliance based upon the principles of commitment, implementation, monitoring, measuring, and continual improvement. There are additional expectations regarding registration for Australian business numbers, goods and services tax, and tax file numbers.Essential Australian legislation includes:⮚ Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004⮚ Federal Privacy Act 1988⮚ Competition and Consumer Act 2010⮚ Australian Corporations Act 2001.You are encouraged to contact the Australian Business License Service for further information about laws specific to your organisation.Activity 1CSummative AssessmentsAt the end of your Learner Workbook, you will find the Summative Assessments. This includes:⮚ Skills assessment⮚ Knowledge assessment⮚ Performance assessment.This holistically assesses your understanding and application of the skills, knowledge and performance requirements for this unit. Once this is completed, you will have finished this unit and be ready to move onto the next one – well done!1. Identify five sources of information about compliance requirements.*2.

They follow the established legal principles and ensure that individuals are treated with appropriate dignity and respect. Ethical frameworks are used as guidance when making decisions which impact employees and other business associates. Managers and other key staff members take responsibility for acting within the ethical framework and setting positive examples.International expectationsThere are distinct ethical frameworks that apply to different types of businesses. International organisations must account for the laws and ethics that apply in foreign countries. They have to meet different expectations with regards to the ways in which business is conducted. Decisions that may be deemed ethically sound in one country may be frowned upon in another. It is advisable to write distinct codes of conduct in line with the cultural and ethical principles that apply in different countries. You should also consider the sensitive cultural issues in the countries where you are working. There should be regular communication with employees to ensure that they are aware of international standards.Codes of conduct and ethics should include the following details:⮚ Ethical principles⮚ Professional values⮚ Ethical responsibilities of senior management⮚ Guidance on accountability within the business⮚ Appropriate standards of conduct and practice⮚ Means of establishing and maintaining standards of discipline⮚ Ways of maintaining relationships with business associates and members of the public⮚ Specific requirements relating to working hours and practices.Businesses that adapt sound ethical frameworks may avoid:⮚ Discrimination⮚ Corruption⮚ Unionisation⮚ Tax avoidance⮚ Bribery⮚ Corruption.Australian ethical standardsYou should also be aware of the ethical frameworks that apply to businesses in the different states of Australia. It is important to maintain general principles of respect and integrity when dealing with customers and colleagues. Business managers should implement policies to ensure that everybody is treated fairly and equally. Australian businesses may draw upon the skills of a multicultural workforce. Employees at all levels will expect to have a say in business decisions. You will also be expected to maintain a fair degree of privacy and confidentiality.Scope of practice considerationsThe scope of practice considerations relate to the specific decisions and functions that you have to carry out on an everyday basis. It is absolutely essential that such actions are carried out in accordance with the ethical standards set by your organisation. You may be required to comply with the ethicalstandards when employing new staff members and making promotional decisions. You might also have responsibility for supervising and assigning duties in a fair manner. You should follow the principles established in the codes of conduct and ethics.You must consider the responsibilities for:⮚ Maintaining principles of justice⮚ Preventing discrimination⮚ Acting with integrity despite pressure in the workplace⮚ Respecting the rights of privacy and confidentiality⮚ Acting with self-control and discipline⮚ Following business conventions⮚ Respecting the right to freedom of speech⮚ Refusing to engage in slander.Activity 2A2.3 Evaluate responsibilities to workers, clients and the broader communityBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Identify their responsibilities to workers⮚ Identify their responsibilities to clients⮚ Identify their responsibilities to the broader community.Evaluating responsibilities to workersYour organisation has a variety of legal and ethical responsibilities to workers, clients, and the broader community. It is important to respect the rights of these distinctive groups and not focus solely on profitability. The nature of your organisation will have a direct bearing on the types of responsibilities that should be upheld. It may be necessary to oversee the use of heavy industrial machinery and ensure that high standards of health and safety are maintained. You may also have to find ways of minimising the environmental impact of any work that is undertaken.Responsibilities to workersHealth and safetyEmployers have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their workers. They should create clear policies and procedures to highlight the safest ways of carrying out business tasks. Machinery should be maintained and regular inspections undertaken to ensure that employees are acting in accordance with the health and safety standards. Organisations must also abide by legislation regarding the storage of potentially hazardous chemicals and maintenance of safe working environments.WHS legislation stipulates that employers must provide their staff with:⮚ Safe premises⮚ Safe machinery and materials⮚ Safe systems of work⮚ Information, instruction, training and supervision⮚ A suitable working environment and facilities.Employees are also obliged to ensure that they work safely and do not endanger the safety of their colleagues, clients and others.How WHS affects your work in health will vary according to your job role and your industry. In order to work safely and legally in your role, you should have been trained to do so by your organisation, as this is a legal requirement.Where you identify possible or actual WHS breaches in your planned responses, they will need to be reviewed and amended to be compliant immediately before they are used again.Equal opportunitiesEmployers should recognise their responsibility to ensure that workers are given equal opportunities for advancement. It is also important to maintain fair rates of pay and recognise the contributions of all employees. The minimum wage rate varies depending upon age and other circumstances. However, employers must be aware of the legislation and make appropriate wage adjustments. It is also important to safeguard employees against discrimination in the workplace. If discrimination does occur, then it should be investigated and dealt with according to the law.Equal opportunity/discriminationAll people should be valued and treated with respect when it comes to their individual differences. The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 was created to be enforced in all workplaces. It identifies features that may cause prejudices among groups of people.Discrimination means unfair treatment of a person based on prejudices.Under the Act, it is illegal for any person or establishment to discriminate against another based on:⮚ Gender⮚ Marital status⮚ Sexual preference⮚ Race⮚ Culture/religious beliefs⮚ Personal principles or beliefs⮚ Pregnancy⮚ Age⮚ Physical or mental impairment.Responsibilities to clientsIt is absolutely essential for businesses to maintain positive relationships with their clients. Companies with high levels of customer engagement appreciate the importance of inviting and responding to feedback. They encourage customers to give their opinions about the development and improvement of products and services. It is only natural for business representatives to be enthusiastic about the features and benefits of their goods and services. However, it is important to provide customers with realistic information. Ethical companies also maintain fair pricing policies and deal with complaints in the appropriate manner. They establish systems for the protection of customer information and only share details with third parties when the customers give their consent.Rights and responsibilities of clientsAll clients have certain statutory rights that must be awarded to them regardless of your personal opinion of them.Rights may include:⮚ To be treated in a professional and courteous manner⮚ To have differences respected, in relation to:o raceo ethnicityo gendero nationalityo sexual orientationo religiono ageo disabilityo economic situationo personal values⮚ Respect for personal privacy and confidentiality⮚ A right to a safe environment⮚ A right to choice of services⮚ Participation in decisions concerning their care⮚ A right to complain⮚ A right to view information held about them⮚ Consultation on any changes to the services they receive.Competition and Consumer Act 2010The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 replaced the Trade Practices 1974. It promotes fair trading and competition for businesses, as well as protecting the consumers their products are aimed at.It covers the following:⮚ Dealings with suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, customers and competitors⮚ Industry codes of practices⮚ Product safety⮚ Unfair market practices⮚ Product labelling⮚ Price⮚ Industry regulation (e.g. gas, electricity, airports, telecommunications).The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is in charge of enforcing the Competition and Consumer Act.Consumer protection lawThe Australian Consumer Law (ACL) came into effect on January 1, 2011.The ACL includes:⮚ A national unfair contract terms law covering standard form consumer contracts⮚ A national law guaranteeing consumer rights when buying goods and services⮚ A national product safety law and enforcement system⮚ A national law for unsolicited consumer agreements covering door-to-door sales and telephone sales⮚ Simple national rules for lay-by agreements⮚ New penalties, enforcement powers and consumer redress options.It applies in all States and Territories and to all Australian businesses, for all transactions that have occurred since January 1, 2011. The full text is set out in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, in Schedule 2.Australian Government Policy Framework for Consumer Protection in Electronic CommerceConsumer Protection in Electronic Commerce is designed to provide consumer protection for people who make purchases online and online businesses.The policy requires:⮚ Accurate and sufficient information is provided about the product⮚ A secure payment process⮚ The availability and provision of effective and accessible redress⮚ Agreement upon relevant areas of jurisdiction⮚ That customer information is protected and remains private.Responsibilities to the broader communityThere’s a good chance that your business operations will have a direct impact on the surrounding environment and people in the local community. However, you can offset the potentially negative impacts by offering training opportunities, employing local people and supporting community initiatives. Local businesses and residents may also enjoy the benefits of quality services. There is a great emphasis on the environmental sustainability of businesses at present. Ethical companies develop initiatives to limit their environmental impact and encourage employees to take part in local projects. The introduction and maintenance of social projects may have an overwhelmingly positive impact on public perceptions of your business.Activity 2B2.4 – Model ethical behaviour in own workBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Model ethical behaviour⮚ Train employees.Modelling ethical behaviourYou can set a positive example for other employees to follow by modelling ethical behaviour in your own work. It is particularly important for senior managers and other key business representatives to lead by example. The standards that they set will be picked up by other members of the organisation and have a direct impact on the employee’s work.Managers with good ethical standards will:⮚ Take the lead and model ethical behaviour⮚ Take colleague’s views into account and explain the ethical reasons for business decisions⮚ Include details of business ethics in different forms of communication⮚ Encourage discussions about ethical issues⮚ Ensure that ethical principles are outlined for all employees⮚ Act upon the sound advice and suggestions made by subordinates.Acting as a role modelIt is important act in accordance with the codes of conduct and ethics. Your organisation may also provide an employee handbook for guidance on how to act in different situations. You should show a respect for your colleagues and customers. Treat everybody fairly and show appreciation for other people’s contributions. Don’t talk behind people’s backs or discriminate for any reason. Accept ultimate responsibility for your own decisions and actions, despite the potentially negative repercussions. Fulfil your duties, as outlined in the job description and maintain compliance with established organisational policies.You should remember the ethical principle of doing unto to others as you would have them do unto you. Consider the implications of what you say and how you act in the workplace. Respect other people’s rights to privacy and freedom of speech. Take any feedback into account and don’t burden others with duties that they will struggle to perform. Follow through on rewards and punishments for ethical or unethical behaviour in the workplace.It is essential to show respect for the organisation that you are working for. You should take care when claiming expenses and using resources in the workplace. You should also demonstrate commitment and do your best to maintain positive relationships with customers and other business associates. Adopt ethical selling practices and act appropriately when there are conflicts of interest.Training employeesThere are numerous means of communicating appropriate forms of behaviour in the workplace. Your organisation may arrange training sessions and workshops so that employees can learn about the ethical principles. Example scenarios may be posed, and employees given the opportunity to demonstrate ethical decision-making ability. They should seek assistance whenever there is concern about the ethical implications of decisions.You may highlight the six-step decision-making model:⮚ Define the problem – Identify the issue and consider the scope for impact upon your organisation⮚ Identify alternatives – Consider the various ways of overcoming the problem in accordance with your ethical standards⮚ Evaluate alternatives – Think about the advantages and disadvantages of resolution methods⮚ Make the decision – Choose the best means of resolution for your business⮚ Implement the decision – Take the necessary steps to overcome the problem⮚ Evaluate the decision – Consider the effectiveness of your chosen process for overcoming the problem.Activity 2CSummative AssessmentsAt the end of your Learner Workbook, you will find the Summative Assessments. This includes:⮚ Skills assessment⮚ Knowledge assessment⮚ Performance assessment.This holistically assesses your understanding and application of the skills, knowledge and performance requirements for this unit. Once this is completed, you will have finished this unit and be ready to move onto the next one – well done!1. Write a paragraph about the ethical framework that applies to your business. Include details of international and national considerations.*2. Research, evaluate and write three separate paragraphs on the responsibilities of your organisation or business industry to employees, clients and the broader community. Include details of health and safety, equal opportunities, fair selling strategies, and corporate social responsibilities."

It will also be necessary to consider ethical issues such as discrimination and freedom of speech in the workplace.Your policies and procedures should account for the legal and ethical issues associated with essential business practices. It is important to identify the responsibilities of individual personnel and include descriptions of any technical terms. It is generally advisable to use plain and simple language for the understanding of all employees.

It will be necessary to monitor compliance with laws and regulations, identify potential compliance breaches, and find ways of addressing them. You should write policies and procedures in accordance with compliance standards and file reports to the relevant authorities. However, the compliance responsibilities will ideally be shared between multiple members of your workforce. This is particularly important for large organisations, which have to meet a wide range of compliance requirements. Duties should be shared fairly among workers with the required skills and knowledge to minimise the risks of non-compliance.These employees should assume responsibility for compliance:⮚ Chief executive officer⮚ Director of Compliance⮚ Head of Compliance⮚ Frontline and senior managers⮚ Fraud Investigators⮚ Compliance specialists at the operational level.Relevant external personnel may include:⮚ Legal and business advisors and consultants with expertise in compliance management⮚ Representatives of professional associations and institutes relevant to the organisation's operations and sphere of business⮚ Representatives of relevant authorities in pertinent compliance areas.Ensuring that compliance is maintained by the organisationEmployees should work together in the aim of meeting business objectives and upholding legislative responsibilities. It is quite possible that separate departments will identify means of working inaccordance with compliance. Effective measures may be shared throughout the organisation for the purpose of maintaining compliance.Additional compliance responsibilities and functions:⮚ Developing and monitoring complaint handling systems⮚ Maintaining compliance related management information systems⮚ Ensuring continuous improvement of processes for compliance, including monitoring, evaluation, and review⮚ Organising corporate induction and training processes for compliance management⮚ Documenting compliance requirements relevant to the organisation⮚ Liaising with relevant internal and external personnel on compliance related matters⮚ Distributing information on compliance issues throughout the organisation⮚ Organising and maintaining records about compliance⮚ Reporting processes on compliance management including reports on breaches and rectification action⮚ Specifying compliance management functions, accountabilities, and responsibilities.Activity 3D3.5 – Distribute policies, procedures and legal information to colleagues and peers in a timely fashionBy the end of this chapter, the learner should be able to:⮚ Distribute information organisational policies and procedures to colleagues⮚ Distribute legal information to colleagues.Distributing information to colleaguesIt is important to ensure that colleagues and peers receive information on the introduction of new policies, procedures, and legislation.

The communication will be deemed effective if all of the relevant employees are aware of changing roles and responsibilities.You should distribute the following policies:⮚ Ethical policies – Highlighting the ethical principles that should be maintained by employees⮚ HR policies – Addressing issues such as employment, redundancy, and salary adjustments⮚ Customer service policies – Detailing the appropriate means of communicating with customers⮚ Accountancy policies – Providing essential guidance on financial practices, including the recording of sales and acceptance of financial gifts.Business proceduresThe procedures should highlight the means of achieving the aims set out in your company policies. You may have procedures relating to the everyday duties that employees have to perform. Procedures will also have to be followed when hiring new staff members and supervising activities, where there is some element of risk. Your workers should follow procedures when organising time off and dealing with instances of discrimination in the workplace. There is a good chance that you’ll introduce new procedures and make adjustments over time. It will be necessary to provide your employees with details of new or modified procedures.Legal informationThere are bound to be numerous laws and items of legislation that apply to your business. You will have to ensure that all of your employees are aware of their legal responsibilities, so that you avoid any breaches of compliance. You should monitor changes in the legal framework and distribute informationat the appropriate times. It may be necessary to make changes to legal documents for general understanding. You should also present legal information in accessible formats for your workers.You may use the following means of communication:⮚ Noticeboard postings⮚ Intranet or business network⮚ Presentations⮚ Staff handbooks⮚ Emails⮚ Formal letters⮚ Newsletters⮚ Notes in regularly accessed areas⮚ Cloud servers⮚ Reports.Considering the choicesThe choice of communication method will depend on the types of information that you are sending.
